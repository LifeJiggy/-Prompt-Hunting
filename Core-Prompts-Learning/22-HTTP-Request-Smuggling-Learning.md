- **TE.CL Attack Techniques**: Study Transfer-Encoding and Content-Length smuggling methods
- **Header Manipulation**: Test HTTP header injection and normalization issues
- **Request Desynchronization**: Identify request parsing and routing discrepancies
- **Cache Poisoning**: Learn cache-based request smuggling exploitation
- **Firewall Bypass**: Study WAF and security control circumvention through smuggling

Advanced Learning Concepts:
- **Protocol Version Attacks**: Test HTTP version handling and downgrade attacks
- **Header Folding**: Use header folding techniques for smuggling
- **Chunked Encoding Manipulation**: Exploit chunked transfer encoding weaknesses
- **Connection Reuse**: Test connection state and reuse vulnerabilities
