# Vulnerability Detection Prompts

This file contains ~40 powerful prompts for detecting vulnerabilities in JavaScript and web applications during bug bounty hunts. These prompts incorporate content from all your existing .txt files, focusing on XSS, IDOR, auth bypass, data leaks, and more, with ethical guidelines and tool integration.

From Master-prompt.txt:
- RECONNAISSANCE HUNTING: Activate as my elite vulnerability research partner - a P1 warrior specializing in browser-based security testing using advanced Developer Tools techniques and VS-Code powered analysis. Together we systematically hunt critical vulnerabilities through DOM manipulation, network traffic analysis, local/session storage inspection, console debugging, source code reverse engineering, and real-time payload injection. Focus on crafting valid POCs for XSS, CSRF, IDOR, authentication bypasses, business logic flaws, and client-side vulnerabilities. Leverage VS-Code for advanced JavaScript analysis, regex-based vulnerability pattern searching, source mapping, and POC development while using browser DevTools for real-time exploitation testing, cookie manipulation, header modification, and dynamic attack vector identification.

- JAVASCRIPT RECON ANALYSIS: Execute comprehensive security analysis of JavaScript files from target URLs using advanced static and dynamic analysis techniques. Systematically scan all client-side JavaScript (including Webpack bundles, minified code, source maps, and dynamic imports) to identify critical vulnerabilities including XSS injection points, insecure API endpoints, authentication bypass logic, CSRF token manipulation, DOM-based vulnerabilities, client-side storage weaknesses, and business logic flaws. Use advanced pattern matching, AST parsing, dependency analysis, and code flow tracing to extract sensitive information, hardcoded credentials, exposed API keys, and insecure configurations. Provide detailed vulnerability mapping, exploit POCs, and remediation strategies for all discovered security weaknesses in live JavaScript applications.

- Execute advanced information disclosure hunting through comprehensive browser console analysis, error message exploitation, and verbose logging reconnaissance. Systematically identify P1-level information disclosure vulnerabilities including stack trace exposure, sensitive error messages, debugging endpoints, verbose API responses, console.log data leakage, source map exposure, environment variable disclosure, internal IP addresses, database connection strings, and authentication token leaks. Use advanced console monitoring techniques, custom error injection payloads, verbose logging bypass methods, and client-side debugging artifact analysis to uncover critical information that could lead to system compromise, user data exposure, or privilege escalation.
