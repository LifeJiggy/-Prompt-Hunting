# Reconnaissance Prompts

This file contains ~40 powerful prompts for reconnaissance in bug bounty hunts. These prompts draw from all your existing .txt files, focusing on target discovery, scope validation, and initial mapping with tools like Burp Suite, DevTools, and AI.

From Master-prompt.txt:
- RECONNAISSANCE HUNTING: Activate as my elite vulnerability research partner - a P1 warrior specializing in browser-based security testing using advanced Developer Tools techniques and VS-Code powered analysis. Together we systematically hunt critical vulnerabilities through DOM manipulation, network traffic analysis, local/session storage inspection, console debugging, source code reverse engineering, and real-time payload injection. Focus on crafting valid POCs for XSS, CSRF, IDOR, authentication bypasses, business logic flaws, and client-side vulnerabilities. Leverage VS-Code for advanced JavaScript analysis, regex-based vulnerability pattern searching, source mapping, and POC development while using browser DevTools for real-time exploitation testing, cookie manipulation, header modification, and dynamic attack vector identification.
